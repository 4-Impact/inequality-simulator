## Vision 

![Slide 2](_static/IUPUISlide2.jpg)

JupyterBridge is tailored for adult learners, particularly those without a coding background. It focuses on supporting learners in harnessing tech innovations (AI, machine learning) to enhance skills and opportunities. Rapid advancements in information technology often leave non technical adults overwhelmed or intimidated. This creates a significant barrier to entry, preventing innovations from being full accessible. Jupyter Bridge aims to dismantle these barriers

## Project Based Approach

Over the last several years coding has become more accessible, with new languages like Python, Julia, and Blocky. In addition new interfaces like notebooks, and no code low code approaches have been porduced. This is like assembly line for code. It makes code much more accessible and obviates the need for a computer science degree to code. 

## What Jupyter Bridge Brings

Jupyter Bridge is an interface  designed to allow users only see the code when they feel comfortable. 

**First Scaffold**

Users will see no code in interface and can walks through the major aspects of the code that produces their tool of interest.

**Second Scaffold**

A toggle button ðŸ“• to see an explanation of the code that produces that accomplishes that task. 

**Third Scaffold**

A toggle button &#128065; to see the code that accomplished that task.
