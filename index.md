# Inequality Simulator
##  To Advance the Conversation 

---

Much of our current conversation about wealth inequality is stuck in the 1800s. However, humanity has learned a lot since the 1800s (horse drawn wagons vs rockets).

This simulation helps users explore different government policies to see their impact. The base model in Bouchard and Mezard wealth inequality, which used physics based dynamics to identify that economic phenomenon are similar to statistical physics. This simulation then layers in different policies of Powerful leaders, Equal wealth distribution, and access to capital for innovation. This allows users to see the impact of these four strategies on wealth creation, the ability to move from one economic class to another, this distribution of wealth, and the gini coefficient which is a measure of wealth distribution (1 - means one person has all the wealth and 0 means each person has the exact same amount of wealth). **This should not be used to implement policy, but should be used to help humanity get past antiquated conversations of the economics that defy known physical properties.**   

Users have 4 choices - 
1. econophysics (base model) agent randomly exchange money to survive and thrive 
2. fascist ()
3. equal wealth distribution
4. innovation (individuals receive an innovation multiplier and if they receive enough money can invest)
